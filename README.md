# LOGIN-AUTHENTICATION

The project aims to address a critical challenge faced by many student management systems: the security vulnerabilities inherent in their login mechanisms. At the frontend of this project is the development of a robust Login Authentication System designed to fortify the authentication process, particularly in educational institutions. Leveraging advanced technologies such as React JS for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL for the database, this system represents a significant step forward in enhancing both the efficiency and security of student admissions processes.
